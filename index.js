Because you\'ve got an interesting way of going about it. I\'m ok with this, I can work with this, this is what we do. I do this. (That\'s an ICP reference. Get it?) Or am I wrong? Are you hurt or offended by something I said? Have I wronged you somehow? Are you upset? Do you feel trolled? As your friend, I feel obliged to inform you that if you said "yes" to any of these questions, you might be misattributing things to me which do not exist. If you don\'t understand what that means, how about don\'t sit there and tell me I\'m both somehow subjective and also wrong. You can\'t have it both ways. So what\'s it going to be, chummer? I am The House. And The House says the door is open. Are you going to walk in here, fuck my shit up, and steal my properties? Ok, that\'s rude. We could also just chill. If I think I\'m someone who thinks they\'re deeper than they actually are, then clearly I must dig deeper. I died once, true story. Listen... everything I\'ve said in this thread... you must read in a voice with a friendly tone. And before you interrupted me, a youthful jubilence. You\'re abrasive, I\'m sure you already know that. I understand I can be abrasive as well. I can understand you, I need you to understand me. If you don\'t understand me, we can\'t be friends.

Well then, Master Edgeworth, I\'ll start with the good news.', 'The President\'s safe. Not even a scratch on him.', 'Whoa there. Don\'t forget, there\'s still the bad news.', 'The President is safe because his bodyguards protected him.', 'Actually... I had nothing to do with it. It was the leader who protected him.', 'At the cost of his own life...', 'Yeah. That\'s right. Rooke died to protect the President...', 'It means that the little lady killed him. My brother in arms.', 'Whoa there. Pipe down, Little Miss Murderer.', 'Geez. Even if we had to make a sacrifice to protect the King...', 'It was a pretty bad move. That castling...', 'Hm?

And this one\'s a doozy.', 'From here on out, this investigation will be handled by the Zheng Fa Police.', 'You\'re Prosecutor Edgeworth, right?', 'The President knows about you solving the Yatagarasu case.', 'That\'s why the Chief Prosecutor designated you to be in charge of the case...', 'I didn\'t know you\'d have this kind of reaction.', '...It\'s the President\'s orders.

It sucks.', 'Tsk! What\'s so different about me and Rooke?', 'The security arrangements were changed...', '...so that de Killer would not be able to sneak in as a bodyguard again.', 'Only the President\'s two most trusted subordinates would accompany him on stage.', 'In short, me and Rooke...', '\'Cuz I can\'t turn my head to the right. My position got changed to the President\'s left side...', 'In other words, I was relocated to the right side of the stage.', 'Ah, yeah.', 'We were always issued the same model revolver.', '...That\'s right. It\'d be dangerous if he hadn\'t worn that bulletproof vest.', 'Yeah, the bullet\'s impact can still fracture your bones.', 'But, don\'t worry, he\'s fine. The President\'s trained himself like no other!', 'I think that\'d be difficult...', 'The bullet was completely flattened when it hit the bulletproof vest.', 'There\'s no way you could investigate the ballistic markings.', 'There\'s no chance in hell I\'m letting that happen!', 'You think you can just summon the President like a witness in court?

That Steel Samurai balloon was a last minute replacement.', 'That\'s what we were told. Seems that information didn\'t make it to the president.', 'We ran into a little trouble during setup last night. One of the balloons that we had prepared burst.', 'Exactly. We just happened to run into a guy manning a stand in the park. He said he\'d lend us the Steel Samurai balloon.', 'We pumped air into its red samurai pants, to create a makeshift balloon.', 'Sir! I\'m terribly sorry. I didn\'t think it was important enough to report...', 'Hey, Edgeworth! Do you even know how to use your \"pieces\"? The one that\'s been taken is yours!', 'That\'s it... With that kind of trajectory, it could only have been a boomerang.', 'He he heh... You really got something like that?!', 'Wh-What!?', 'Prosecutor Edgeworth, I\'ve had it up to here with you! My job is to protect the president!', 'Like he says, if I were the assassin, I\'d need to have something to gain from it. Because the moment I killed the president... ...I\'d be out of a job as a bodyguard!', 'Why then! Why was it necessary for me to do a thing like that!?', '...How dare you!? Do you seriously understand what you\'re implying with this?', 'Well played, Mr. Prosecutor.', 'Objection!', 'Oops, sorry. I went over the top there.', 'But onto business... As my first move, I wanna ask you a question.', 'You say I fired a gun on the stage, right? Then I should\'ve been caught. The entire audience was watching me!', 'A certain object...?', 'How should I know? You tell me.', 'So, what exactly is so strange, Mr. Prosecutor?', 'The attaché case...!', 'You seem to enjoy making up convenient stories, Mr. Prosecutor. But, you\'ve missed something.', 'That everything you\'ve said is just a hypothesis. A theory.', 'Flags flapping in the wind? Using the case as a screen? The security plans were modified \'cause I can\'t move my neck? You\'ve got no decisive evidence!', 'Yeah, it\'d be great if you had the bullet that hit the balloon. Then you could examine it, and see if the ballistic markings matched my gun.', 'But that bullet\'s probably at the bottom of the lake. Finding it would be real tough, right?', 'If there\'s no proof, the only thing you can do is shut up. So do so!', 'There we go. I thought so.', 'You\'d better consider your position! Use your head before saying something you\'ll regret.', 'You stupid womaaan!', 'If you testify, you\'ll be admitting you\'re an accomplice!', 'Damn you! The lot of you! You\'re all a bunch of mindless morons...', '...Blast!', 'I-I admit nothing...!', 'Tsk... You\'re being too dramatic.', 'Rooke was just one piece of the president\'s defense.', 'And it\'s not as if he cooperated with your plan. I did.', 'He ran away, taking whatever dignity he had left with him. Good riddance.', 'I don\'t have time for this, sir. I\'m the team leader now. There\'s going to be a lot of changes now that the chicken\'s gone.', 'Hehehe. I will orchestrate even more perfect plans, just like this one.', 'If it weren\'t for you and that idiot Rooke, it would have been perfect!', 'If he hadn\'t died, de Killer wouldn\'t have threatened me...', '...and you would have never set foot in this plane.', 'Yeah, he died trying to save you, Mr. President. Maybe he fulfilled his lifelong ambition.', 'Of course it was, But you need to listen closer, little girl.', 'Remember the \"guy who wanted to make the fake assassination real\"?', 'There were two gunshots at the time of the incident. The first was as you said. I shot the balloon. BUT... The second one wasn\'t me.', 'The REAL assassin. ...But, it wasn\'t De Killer.', 'He intended to attack the president with a knife, not a gun.', 'The lucky winner was the hidden Queen...', '...or should I say, the lady in the coat over there.', 'Really? I don\'t believe you. The gun that was left in the trash... That was yours, right?', '*I shot the balloon and entered the plane with Rooke and the president.*', '*Rooke waited in the cabin while I led the president into the security room.*', '*When I came out, Rooke was already on the ground...*', '*The bullet that lady fired must have hit him while we escorted the president to the plane.*', '*The shot was fired from the gun you found in the trash!*', 'A Knight\'s job isn\'t to protect the Rook. It\'s to protect the King!', 'But I did win! Look! The president is safe!', 'Yeah, that\'s right. He didn\'t even know it was all fake.', 'Maybe he did. Not that it matters now. Besides, even if he thought the assassination attempt was a fake... His duty was to protect the King.', 'You\'re wrong. It was all part of my plan. He simply assisted in our little performance on stage!', 'There were a lot of "guests" milling around outside. Wouldn\'t it be bad if the president, who just escaped an assassination... ...was seen lounging around and drinking grape juice? Imagine the headlines.', 'How should I know? I was with the president inside the security room. Anyway...', 'About where he is now. He collapsed in the middle of this room. When I returned, the door to the plane was already closed...', 'The bullet must\'ve hit Rooke right before the door closed. Talk about a hassle. It\'s all his fault that this plan failed.', 'Even if he protected the king, he couldn\'t protect his honor. He was careless in his duty and he paid the price for it.', 'Yeah. When Rooke noticed the laser pointer... We opened up those bad boys and became the president\'s shield.', 'Well, she was targeting the president. I wouldn\'t say her aim is precise at all.', 'I don\'t want to believe it either, but they say the truth is stranger than fiction.', 'Rooke was hit by a one-in-a-million shot. And you have the evidence to prove it.', 'That\'s right. She did that on her own. If you think about it, wasn\'t she desperate for a scoop?', 'It\'s just like you said, I orchestrated this fake assassination attempt. She was only supposed to aim the laser pointer... I guess it wasn\'t enough for her.', 'She prepared her own gun and took aim at the president. She probably thought she wouldn\'t get caught if she went on and shot me too.', 'I can\'t see it any other way.', '!', '...He he he. Here it comes. You\'re packing some serious heat.', 'Enough with the song and dance. You\'ve come this far, go ahead and say it!', 'Hey, you... You really don\'t know anything, do you? Was that supposed to be a joke, or are you serious?', 'Heh... You finally said it.', 'A third bullet...?', 'Hah! Only two gunshots were heard! The numbers don\'t match up!', '........', 'You really think I killed that moron? That\'s cold, Mr. President.', 'Have a little faith in me. The bodyguard who\'s risking his life to protect you.', 'I just don\'t get it. Why are you suspecting me alone? There\'s still the possibility that she\'s the killer.', '...Maybe it was one short to begin with. Ever think of that?', 'Maybe it already fired a shot yesterday, or the day before. And the second shot was fired today. The one that hit Rooke...', 'Excuse? The possibility exists, you can\'t deny that!', 'You need decisive evidence! Evidence so decisive that it makes my heart stop and my logic crumble! You got something like that?', 'If you\'ve got no evidence, then we\'re done talking.', '...Wh-What? You don\'t seriously have decisive evidence!?', 'That\'s a big joke. Well, come on now, show us! What is this so-called evidence!?', 'Just as I hoped, I\'m gonna blast a hole in ya! Right in your chest!', 'OK! OK! It\'s game over, man!', '...Interesting. Very interesting. Do you have the answer?', 'Well then, why don\'t you take the bullet out and show it to us?', 'Ho ho. Well, maybe by tomorrow, a bullet will have appeared in it. Have you decided to join the Gramarye magician group?', 'Nrrrgghh...!', 'President Huang! You said extraterritorial laws apply to this plane...', 'Dammit! You think this is a joke!? You\'re always like this! Rooke this, Rooke that...!', '.......', '...He he he he he he. Huh? That\'s strange.', 'Looks like I was right after all... naturally.', 'Did you really think you had me cornered?', 'You misread the board...', 'The one who\'s been cornered... is you!', '*If the ballistic markings match the gun, there can be no doubt!*', '*The bullet that killed Rooke was fired from the gun you found in the audience area.*', '*Who could\'ve used the gun?*', '*Not me, \'cuz I was onstage. But what about that lady reporter in the audience?*', '*All the evidence points to that young lady as the assassin who killed Rooke!*', 'Well, it\'s your move, Mr. Prosecutor. Where did you find this gun again?', 'And which gun fired the bullet? At least we know... It ain\'t me!', 'The president and I have admitted to the fake assassination plot. Now it\'s your turn to admit who the real criminal is!', 'Didn\'t you say it earlier? This is the decisive evidence.', 'Well? How does it feel to have a hole blown through your reasoning?', 'Well, your prosecutor\'s badge seems a little doubtful to me. Could be a fake. That\'d explain the poor job you\'re doing here. Aha ha!', 'You just don\'t know when to quit. Are you secretly having doubts about the evidence?', 'You should know better than anyone that the evidence never lies. Besides...', '...don\'t you know it\'s against the rules to yell "Hold it!" during chess?', 'Looks like your turn\'s over. It\'s my move now.', 'You\'re the one who should \"Hold it\". You proved it yourself. Don\'t tell me that you\'re going to betray your own logic?', 'Nice. Nice. Your face betrays your thoughts, Mr. Prosecutor.', 'Now that you\'ve got a firm grasp of reality, it\'s time to take the next step... The link between the gun and the bullet is clear. So...', 'You already know the answer, you just don\'t wanna admit it, huh? I know the feeling.', 'It\'s probably like how I felt before. Feeling so irritated, you\'re just itching to pull the trigger!', '...But, this ain\'t the time to be joking around. Only one person could have used that gun...', 'Whoa there, didn\'t the boys in blue already prove that?', 'Well, that\'s \'cuz I was handling all the evidence earlier.', 'If that lady isn\'t the killer, who else could it be? You were the one who cornered the assassin in the audience.', 'Capisce? In fact, from every angle on the board...', 'Well, what exactly HAVE you proved? Oh, yeah. You proved that I fired the first bullet.', 'But, you\'re forgetting one crucial thing. Why were you called here in the first place?', 'Do you consider the worsening relationship with Zheng Fa to be the truth? No.', 'Your purpose here was to solve the attempted assassination incident.', 'Whatever. If you spend all day arguing like this, the case is gonna go unsolved.', 'Just give it up already. The real criminal is that lady over there.', '......Heh. Interesting choice of move you\'ve made there.', 'He he heh. Did I do that?', 'So, what you\'re saying is that I knew you\'d want to examine the ballistic markings?', 'I\'m glad you feel that way, Mr. Prosecutor. But you\'re giving me too much credit.', 'Besides... can you even prove I pulled the old switcheroo with the guns?', '*So the gun happens to be the same model as mine. Pure coincidence...*', '*But, take a closer look. Only one of them has a laser pointer attached to it.*', '*Check the number of bullets left in the chamber. Only two shots fired, see?*', '*There\'s no evidence that I switched the guns, right?*', 'Guess I\'m just more modest than you. Well... Except when I\'m in front of a chessboard.', 'That\'s too bad. Don\'t use that as an excuse later.', '\"I didn\'t lose the game. I just couldn\'t find enough evidence.\"', 'Or perhaps, it was simply bound to happen.', 'Us bodyguards needed to use them to protect the president. And no matter how you slice it, that lady is a total amateur with guns. It was necessary for both of us to use revolvers.', 'When you gotta get the job done, or if you\'re new to this sorta thing, there\'s nothing better.', 'The truth is, I thought it was \"pure coincidence\" all along.', 'Oh yeah? Prove it. Show me the evidence.', 'You can\'t go around calling people liars without proof... Didn\'t your daddy teach you that?', 'On that point, I\'ve got evidence on my side.', 'My woman here? ...Now that you mention it. I\'ve been firing it off for a while now.', 'So there\'s no way to check its status from the time of the incident.', 'Well, I think it\'s about time for you to resign. How about it, Prosecutor Edgeworth?', 'There isn\'t any. If there is, show it to me.', 'He he he... If you\'ve got something to show, let me know.', 'You call that evidence? Prosecutor Edgeworth. You\'re trying too hard.', 'Show it to me! What kinda piece you got!', 'A Rook? A Bishop? It better not be a pawn!', 'You sure about that? You don\'t seem to get it.', 'The markings point to me, huh? Just what kind of ballistic markings are they, anyway? Do they spell out my name? Great joke, Prosecutor Edgeworth.', '...And which bloodstain would that be? The only bloodstains I can recall belonged to de Killer and Rooke.', 'Did you find another one? Please do tell. Or perhaps their bloodstains somehow link to the gun?', 'Fingerprints...? Hah! That should be expected!', 'I handled the gun earlier when I seized your evidence. Of course my fingerprints are on it!', 'What!? Th-That\'s not possible!', 'Nngggh!', 'Gah! Th-That\'s...!', '...I-I, I\'m, I\'m!', 'M-M... M... MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!', 'I-I... I should\'ve been made leader! Me!', 'Rooke! That piece of scum! If it hadn\'t been for him!', 'I would\'ve had complete control over everybody!', 'My assassination plan... It was perfect... My plan... was perfect...', 'I...! I...!', 'Gr-Grrr...! Damn it...! Damn... you...', 'You want me, and not Rooke?', '...........', 'Alright. Let\'s do this. I\'ll come up with the perfect plan.', 'I can even use that guy as a chess piece...', 'Got it, Mr. President! Hey Mr. Prosecutor, the only thing contradictory...', 'That so? The only flaw I see...', '...is that it\'s just too perfect, there are no contradictions!', 'Better wipe the board clean, Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like you\'re out of your league!', 'Mr. Prosecutor... Haven\'t you forgotten the rules of chess?', 'GOTCHA! It\'s against the rules to touch a piece and then not move it! Take the penalty!', 'Oh, and you think you\'re any better? Always rambling on and on, you\'re the one who can\'t make a straight point!', 'You sure you have the capacity for this? Mentally speaking.', 'Really!? I\'ll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I\'m looking forward to your performance as well.', 'Alright! You better drop by again. I\'ll be thinking about my next move!', 'Something special? I\'m not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simon.', 'Huh? Did you say something?', 'Now, can you see the path to checkmate? I can\'t wait to see the look on your face... You weren\'t expecting to lose at chess against me, right?', 'You... Where\'d you get that?', 'I bet even Rooke had no idea. That he\'d meet his end at the hands of that little lady!', '......... Yeah, that\'s right. It outlines where Rooke and I were stationed. If only I\'d been in his position, then I\'d be the one who...', 'Urgh... Wh...Why you...!', 'Is that gonna solve the case?', 'Yeah. That\'s right. It was changed yesterday. President\'s orders...', 'Woah, don\'t misgender my lady! She doesn\'t use it/its pronouns! .... Although, President Huang does.', 'Please stop objectifying me...', 'Uh... babe, why do I hear boss music?', 'W-WHAT!? I got rickrolled again!
